# PiHole: Serve web sites from your home network.

### Why I created this.

In an effort to encourage my kids to tinker with technology, I bought them each a Raspberry Pi for their desk. As we talked about projects we could work on together, they continued to ask about creating a web site. Instead of teaching them how to connect to a server capable of serving a public web site, I created pihole to give their Raspberry PIs a public presence on the Internet by tunnelling HTTP requests over ssh.
